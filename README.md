# Learning Reflection Write-up
## Goal:

A weight-loss Mobile Application is a case study aiming to help people lose weight easily. I contributed to the projects by interviewing questions and an Affinity map diagram using (miro.com) and prioritizing the essential features. Paper sketches, low-Fi design, and task flow and Hi-Fi prototype using Figma. Zeplin used to export my prototype file to generate development resources, and loopback usability testing.
